    <p>"This is so stressful! We really need this ship, but I'm not sure we’ll have enough money for it! What if the old
        merchant-bot asks for too much?" Sofia talked to herself as she paced from one end of the room to the other.</p>

    <p>"Of course he will," said Nikola in his typically calm manner.</p>

    <p>"What?!? Do you know him?!? Why didn't you told me this before?!"</p>

    <p>"Well I don’t know him personally, but I know that the robots of his class and release year are notoriously savvy
        merchants. His module is pretty old though so you should offer him just a little bit of money for the ship at
        first and he will counteroffer with a much higher price. Add a little more money to each offer and he will
        reduce his counteroffer by roughly the same amount every time."</p>

    <p>"That sounds like a good strategy. He's a very old robot. Hey, what do you think that old codger is even doing on
        the island? <a class="more"><b>More...</b></a></p>

    <div class="end">
        <p>...I don’t think I’ve seen anyone older than him around here.''</p>

        <p>"Based on my data, he was one of the earliest settlers here to control the shuttle landing strip. It's been
            over 20 years since the last shuttle landed there. Despite that, he still follows his program by keeping the
            landing strip clean and orderly."</p>

        <p>"Sounds like an odd character. Well we really need this ship, we’ll have to make sure that we have enough
            money to buy it.”</p>

    Write a program that will (depending on Sofia and the old man’s initial bargaining sums--the steps by which they will
    increase or decrease the price during their negotiations) calculate which final price they will agree upon. If
    Sofia's offer is lower than or equal to the old man's offer, she will accept the old man's price and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    Sofia makes her offer first. She never offers an amount higher than what is offered to her. On the other hand, the
    old man never offers an amount lower than what is offered to him.

<div>
    <strong>Input data:</strong>
    Contains four integer numbers: Sofia's initial offer, Sofia's raise to her offer, the
    initial counteroffer from the old man, and the old man's reduction in his offer;
</div>
<div><strong>Output data:</strong>
    The amount of money that Sofia will pay for the spaceship.

<div class="for_info_only"><strong>Example:</strong>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio([150, 50, 1000, 100]) == 450
#Sofia: 200
#Oldman: 900
#Sofia: 250
#Oldman: 800
#Sofia: 300
#Oldman: 700
#Sofia: 350
#Oldman: 600
#Sofia: 400
#Oldman: 500
#Sofia: 450
#... old man will be ok with it, because his next proposition will be lower than 450.

# a bit shorter example
checkio([500, 300, 700, 100]) == 700
#Sofia will be ok with 700 because her next proposition will be higher
