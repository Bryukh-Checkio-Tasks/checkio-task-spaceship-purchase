    <p>"This is so stressful! We really need this ship, but I'm not sure we’ll have enough money for it! What if the old
        merchant-bot asks for too much?" Sofia talked to herself as she paced from one end of the room to the other.</p>

    <p>"Of course he will," said Nikola in his typically calm manner.</p>

    <p>"What?!? Do you know him?!? Why didn't you told me this before?!"</p>

    <p>"Well I don’t know him personally, but I know that the robots of his class and release year are notoriously savvy
        merchants. His module is pretty old though so you should offer him just a little bit of money for the ship at
        first and he will counteroffer with a much higher price. Add a little more money to each offer and he will
        reduce his counteroffer by roughly the same amount every time."</p>

    <p>"That sounds like a good strategy. He's a very old robot. Hey, what do you think that old codger is even doing on
        the island? <a class="more"><b>More...</b></a></p>

        <p>...I don’t think I’ve seen anyone older than him around here.''</p>

        <p>"Based on my data, he was one of the earliest settlers here to control the shuttle landing strip. It's been
            over 20 years since the last shuttle landed there. Despite that, he still follows his program by keeping the
            landing strip clean and orderly."</p>

        <p>"Sounds like an odd character. Well we really need this ship, we’ll have to make sure that we have enough
            money to buy it.”</p>
